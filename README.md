# 📚 AI for Communities, Access and Public Impacts (Hackathon Submission)

> **"Bridging the literacy gap by converting complex documents into simple, spoken explanations in local languages."**

## 🚀 Overview
Millions of people struggle to understand formal documents due to literacy barriers or language differences. This project leverages **AWS Generative AI** to solve this by:
1.  **Simplifying** complex text into elementary-level explanations.
2.  **Translating** it into local dialects.
3.  **Speaking** it aloud for users who cannot read.
